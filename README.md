# Python-Instacart
Instacart, an **online grocery store** that operates through an app. The **task** is to perform an initial *data and exploratory analysis* of some of their data in order to derive insights and **suggest strategies for better segmentation** based on some provided criteria.

# Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what **the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day** are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular **times of the day when people
spend the most money**, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain **types of products that are more popular than others**? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the **different types of
customers** in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
